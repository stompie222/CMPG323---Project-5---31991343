# CMPG323--Project-5--31991343
In this Project I have used various visualization Techniques to Report the data obtained by the API and website. I created a live connection to the hosted sharepoint excel file provided in this course. This was a bit of a tricky one as I was unsure that I created the coorrect connection.

There are 3 Pages available . 'High-leve Metrics', 'Device Monitoring' and 'Device registration' Both containing their own unique data visualization.

## 'High-Level Metrics': 
image This page is used to visualy represent High-level metrics that may contain improtant data to the company. I Included what I thought would be important to the company.

## 'Device Monitoring':
image With Device monitoring the user is able to see varouis insightful information regarding to the devices. Like what is acvtive and what zones and catagories are popular.

## 'Device Registration':
image With device registration, a more time focused apprach was taken. Users are able to see visualizations in treads to get a better insight of when devices are registered.

## Reporting and filtering:
There are page specefic filters and then filters that are applicable over all pages. I also included a filter to constantly see what devices are active or inactive
