# CMPG323--Project-5--31991343
For this project, I utilized various data visualization techniques to present data obtained from both an API and a website. One of the challenges I encountered was establishing a live connection to the hosted SharePoint Excel file provided in the course, as I had some initial doubts about the correctness of the connection.

The project consists of three pages: "High-level Metrics," "Order Monitoring," and "Product Monitoring." Each of these pages offers unique data visualizations tailored to their respective purposes.

## 'High-Level Metrics': 
On this page, I focused on visually representing high-level metrics that are potentially significant for the company. I included what I deemed important for the company's needs.

## 'Order Monitoring':
In the "Order Monitoring" section, users can monitor valuable insights about orders, such as their order status and categories.

## 'Product Monitoring':
In the "Product Monitoring" section, I took a more time-oriented approach. Users can monitor visualizations presented in a timeline format to gain a better understanding of when products are ordered.

## Reporting and filtering:
The project includes both page-specific filters and filters that apply across all pages. Additionally, I implemented a filter to continuously monitor the activity status of devices, distinguishing between active and inactive ones.
